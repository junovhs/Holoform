# Research Note: Integrating Dynamic Analysis Information into the Holoform Graph

This document investigates how to integrate dynamic analysis information to weight paths in the Holoform graph.

## 1. The Need for Dynamic Analysis

Static analysis, such as the AST parsing that we are currently using, can only provide a limited view of a program's behavior. Dynamic analysis, on the other hand, can provide a more complete picture by observing the program as it is running.

By integrating dynamic analysis information into the Holoform graph, we can provide the AI with a more complete picture of the program's behavior, which will be essential for tasks like debugging and code modification.

## 2. Proposed Strategy

The following is a proposed strategy for integrating dynamic analysis information into the Holoform graph:

1.  **Use a code coverage tool to collect execution traces.** A code coverage tool, such as `coverage.py`, can be used to collect execution traces that show which lines of code are executed during a particular run of the program.
2.  **Use the execution traces to weight the paths in the Holoform graph.** The execution traces can be used to weight the paths in the Holoform graph, with the more frequently executed paths being given a higher weight.
3.  **Use the weighted graph to guide the AI's analysis.** The weighted graph can be used to guide the AI's analysis, with the AI focusing on the more frequently executed paths first.

This strategy will allow us to combine the strengths of both static and dynamic analysis, which will result in a more powerful and effective bug localization tool.
