# Research Note: Threat Model for Holoform-Guided AI Code Modification

This document defines a preliminary threat model for Holoform-guided AI code modification.

## 1. Threats

The following are the main threats to the security of Holoform-guided AI code modification:

*   **Malicious Code Injection:** An attacker could use the AI to inject malicious code into the program.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could use the AI to make a large number of code modifications that would cause the program to crash.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could use the AI to extract sensitive information from the program.

## 2. Mitigations

The following are some potential mitigations for these threats:

*   **Input Validation:** The AI should validate all user input to ensure that it is not malicious.
*   **Rate Limiting:** The AI should limit the number of code modifications that can be made in a given period of time.
*   **Sandboxing:** The AI should run the modified code in a sandbox to prevent it from accessing sensitive information.
*   **Human Review:** All code modifications should be reviewed by a human before they are deployed to production.

## 3. Next Steps

The next step is to develop a more detailed threat model and to implement the mitigations that have been identified.
