# Research Note: Common Patterns of State Change in Python

This document analyzes common patterns of state change in Python, with the goal of informing the design of the Holoform representation for state modifications.

## 1. Direct Attribute Assignment

This is the most common pattern of state change in Python. It involves directly assigning a value to an attribute of an object.

```python
my_object.my_attribute = "new_value"
```

In this example, the state of `my_object` is modified by assigning a new value to the `my_attribute` attribute.

## 2. List Modifications

Lists are mutable objects in Python, and there are a number of ways to modify their state. The most common patterns are:

*   **Appending an element:**
    ```python
    my_list.append("new_element")
    ```
*   **Assigning to an index:**
    ```python
    my_list[0] = "new_value"
    ```
*   **Extending a list:**
    ```python
    my_list.extend(["another_element"])
    ```
*   **Removing an element:**
    ```python
    my_list.remove("new_element")
    ```

## 3. Dictionary Modifications

Dictionaries are also mutable objects in Python, and there are a number of ways to modify their state. The most common patterns are:

*   **Assigning to a key:**
    ```python
    my_dict["my_key"] = "new_value"
    ```
*   **Updating with another dictionary:**
    ```python
    my_dict.update({"another_key": "another_value"})
    ```
*   **Deleting a key-value pair:**
    ```python
    del my_dict["my_key"]
    ```

## 4. In-place Operators

Python has a number of in-place operators that modify the state of an object directly. For example:

```python
my_number += 1
my_list *= 2
```

In these examples, the `+=` and `*=` operators modify the state of `my_number` and `my_list` in-place.

## 5. Holoform Representation Implications

The Holoform representation will need to be able to capture all of these different patterns of state change. This will likely require us to introduce a new `state_modification` operation type, with a number of subtypes for the different patterns. For example, we could have the following subtypes:

*   `attribute_assignment`
*   `list_append`
*   `list_index_assignment`
*   `dict_key_assignment`
*   `in_place_operator`

By representing state changes in this way, we can provide the AI with a more complete picture of how the program is behaving, which will be essential for tasks like debugging and code modification.
