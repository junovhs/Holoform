# Research Note: AI-Assisted Code Modification with Holoforms

This document conceptualizes how the Holoform graph and Query API could be used by an LLM to identify locations for code modifications and predict ripple effects.

## 1. Identifying Locations for Code Modifications

The Holoform graph can be used to identify locations for code modifications in a number of ways. For example, if a user wants to add a new feature to a program, they could provide a natural language description of the feature to an AI agent. The AI agent could then use the Holoform graph to identify the relevant functions and classes that need to be modified.

The AI agent could also use the Holoform graph to identify the specific lines of code that need to be modified. For example, if the user wants to change the behavior of a function, the AI agent could use the Holoform graph to identify the operations in the function that are relevant to the change.

## 2. Predicting Ripple Effects

The Holoform graph can also be used to predict the ripple effects of a code modification. For example, if a user wants to change the signature of a function, the AI agent could use the Holoform graph to identify all the functions that call the function and that would be affected by the change.

The AI agent could also use the Holoform graph to predict the impact of a code modification on the program's behavior. For example, if the user wants to change the implementation of a function, the AI agent could use the Holoform graph to identify all the functions that depend on the function and that could be affected by the change.

## 3. Next Steps

The next step is to develop a prototype of an AI-assisted code modification tool that uses the Holoform graph and Query API. This will allow us to start experimenting with AI-assisted code modification tasks.
