# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This experiment aims to discover the "magic moment" that proves Holoform's unique value for AI code understanding. We will conduct a focused comparative study to determine if Holoforms enable LLMs to understand code more accurately than raw source code or other representations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comparative Understanding Experiment

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to prove that Holoforms enable better AI code understanding than raw source code, so that I can validate the core research hypothesis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presenting the same code understanding task to an LLM THEN the system SHALL test three different representations: raw source code, Holoform representation, and AST representation.
2. WHEN evaluating LLM responses THEN the system SHALL measure accuracy, completeness, and insight quality using objective criteria.
3. WHEN selecting test cases THEN the system SHALL include code with complex inter-function dependencies, state modifications, and control flow.
4. WHEN conducting the experiment THEN the system SHALL use at least 10 different code examples of varying complexity.
5. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL identify specific scenarios where Holoforms provide superior understanding.

### Requirement 2: Cross-File Bug Detection Test

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to test if Holoforms help LLMs identify bugs that span multiple files, so that I can demonstrate practical value for debugging tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating test scenarios THEN the system SHALL include bugs that require understanding relationships across multiple files.
2. WHEN presenting bug detection tasks THEN the system SHALL compare LLM performance using raw code files versus Holoform call graphs.
3. WHEN evaluating bug detection THEN the system SHALL measure both accuracy (finding the bug) and explanation quality (understanding why it's a bug).
4. WHEN designing test cases THEN the system SHALL include subtle bugs that are not obvious from single-file analysis.

### Requirement 3: Insight Quality Measurement

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to objectively measure the quality of AI-generated code insights, so that I can quantify the value of Holoform representations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating LLM responses THEN the system SHALL score responses on accuracy, completeness, and depth of understanding.
2. WHEN measuring insight quality THEN the system SHALL compare explanations of code purpose, data flow, and potential issues.
3. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL identify specific types of insights that are enhanced by Holoform representation.
4. WHEN documenting findings THEN the system SHALL provide concrete examples of superior insights enabled by Holoforms.
