# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to develop Milestone 6 of the Holoform project, focusing on scaling the system to handle very large codebases, integrating advanced AI techniques, supporting multiple programming languages, and conducting user studies to evaluate real-world effectiveness. Building on the successful completion of Milestones 1-5, this phase will push Holoform toward production readiness and broader applicability across different programming ecosystems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Large-Scale Codebase Analysis

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want Holoform to efficiently analyze and represent codebases with over 1 million lines of code, so that it can be applied to real-world enterprise software systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a codebase with >1M lines of code THEN the system SHALL successfully generate Holoforms for all supported code constructs.
2. WHEN processing large codebases THEN the system SHALL employ efficient memory management techniques to avoid out-of-memory errors.
3. WHEN generating Holoforms for large codebases THEN the system SHALL maintain a processing speed of at least 10,000 lines of code per minute on standard hardware.
4. WHEN analyzing large codebases THEN the system SHALL support distributed processing to parallelize the workload across multiple cores or machines.
5. WHEN storing Holoforms for large codebases THEN the system SHALL implement efficient storage mechanisms (e.g., database integration, compression) to manage the volume of data.
6. WHEN evaluating performance on large codebases THEN the system SHALL maintain the established semantic fidelity and compression ratio thresholds.

### Requirement 2: Graph Neural Network Integration

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to integrate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Holoform representations, so that I can leverage deep learning techniques for code understanding, bug detection, and other software engineering tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting Holoform representations THEN the system SHALL transform them into a format suitable for GNN processing.
2. WHEN defining GNN architectures THEN the system SHALL support node features that capture the semantic information in Holoforms.
3. WHEN training GNNs THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to generate labeled datasets from Holoform representations.
4. WHEN evaluating GNN performance THEN the system SHALL compare results against baseline methods on tasks such as bug detection, code summarization, and type inference.
5. WHEN using trained GNN models THEN the system SHALL provide an API for integrating predictions into developer tools.
6. WHEN processing Holoform graphs with GNNs THEN the system SHALL handle graphs of varying sizes and complexities.

### Requirement 3: User Studies and Evaluation

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to conduct comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of Holoform in real-world software development scenarios, so that I can validate its practical utility and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing user studies THEN the system SHALL define clear research questions and hypotheses related to Holoform's effectiveness.
2. WHEN recruiting participants THEN the system SHALL include a diverse range of software developers with varying experience levels and backgrounds.
3. WHEN conducting user studies THEN the system SHALL employ both quantitative metrics (e.g., time to complete tasks, accuracy) and qualitative feedback.
4. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL compare Holoform-assisted development against traditional approaches.
5. WHEN evaluating user experience THEN the system SHALL assess factors such as learnability, efficiency, and satisfaction.
6. WHEN reporting findings THEN the system SHALL document insights that can inform future Holoform development.

### Requirement 4: Multi-Language Support

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want Holoform to support multiple programming languages beyond Python, so that it can be applied to a wider range of software projects and ecosystems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the multi-language architecture THEN the system SHALL define a language-agnostic core Holoform schema.
2. WHEN implementing language support THEN the system SHALL initially target at least one additional mainstream language (e.g., JavaScript/TypeScript or Java).
3. WHEN parsing different languages THEN the system SHALL use appropriate AST parsers or compiler frameworks for each supported language.
4. WHEN generating Holoforms THEN the system SHALL map language-specific constructs to the common Holoform schema.
5. WHEN handling language-specific features THEN the system SHALL extend the schema as needed while maintaining backward compatibility.
6. WHEN evaluating multi-language support THEN the system SHALL verify that semantic fidelity and compression metrics meet established thresholds across all supported languages.

### Requirement 5: IDE Integration

**User Story:** As a software developer, I want Holoform to integrate with popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), so that I can leverage its capabilities directly within my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing IDE integrations THEN the system SHALL target at least two popular IDEs (e.g., VS Code, JetBrains IDEs).
2. WHEN implementing IDE plugins THEN the system SHALL provide features such as code navigation, bug detection, and code summarization based on Holoform representations.
3. WHEN displaying Holoform information THEN the system SHALL present it in an intuitive, developer-friendly format.
4. WHEN processing code changes THEN the system SHALL leverage the incremental update capabilities to provide real-time feedback.
5. WHEN integrating with IDE features THEN the system SHALL complement existing tools rather than duplicating functionality.
6. WHEN evaluating IDE integration THEN the system SHALL measure performance impact to ensure it doesn't significantly slow down the development experience.

### Requirement 6: Advanced Dynamic Analysis Integration

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to integrate dynamic analysis data with Holoform's static representations, so that I can create more accurate and comprehensive code models that capture runtime behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting dynamic analysis data THEN the system SHALL instrument code to capture execution traces, variable values, and performance metrics.
2. WHEN integrating dynamic data THEN the system SHALL associate it with the corresponding Holoform nodes and edges.
3. WHEN representing dynamic behavior THEN the system SHALL extend the Holoform schema to include runtime information.
4. WHEN analyzing dynamic patterns THEN the system SHALL identify common execution paths, hot spots, and potential performance issues.
5. WHEN combining static and dynamic analysis THEN the system SHALL provide a unified view that enhances code understanding and debugging.
6. WHEN evaluating the integrated approach THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improved accuracy in tasks such as bug localization compared to static analysis alone.
