# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to research and develop symbolic chain representation as an extreme token compression technique for Holoforms. Based on initial experiments showing 97% token reduction while preserving semantic understanding, this research will systematically explore the potential of symbolic notation for representing code behavior in ultra-compressed formats.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Symbolic Notation Research

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to understand the theoretical foundations of symbolic chain representation, so that I can develop a systematic approach to extreme token compression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN researching symbolic notation THEN the system SHALL document existing symbolic systems used in mathematics, logic, and computer science.
2. WHEN analyzing code behavior patterns THEN the system SHALL identify the most common causal relationships that can be represented symbolically.
3. WHEN defining notation rules THEN the system SHALL create a consistent symbolic vocabulary for code constructs.
4. WHEN evaluating notation effectiveness THEN the system SHALL measure comprehension accuracy across different symbolic representations.
5. WHEN documenting findings THEN the system SHALL provide clear examples of symbolic notation for common code patterns.

### Requirement 2: Symbolic Chain Generator Prototype

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to automatically generate symbolic chain representations from Holoforms, so that I can systematically test extreme token compression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Holoforms THEN the system SHALL identify causal chains and data flow patterns.
2. WHEN generating symbolic notation THEN the system SHALL apply consistent rules for representing relationships.
3. WHEN handling different code constructs THEN the system SHALL support functions, conditionals, loops, and state modifications.
4. WHEN optimizing for compression THEN the system SHALL minimize token usage while preserving essential semantic information.
5. WHEN validating output THEN the system SHALL ensure symbolic chains accurately represent the original code behavior.

### Requirement 3: LLM Comprehension Testing

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to test how well LLMs understand symbolic chain representations, so that I can validate the effectiveness of extreme token compression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing test cases THEN the system SHALL create diverse code examples with varying complexity.
2. WHEN generating symbolic chains THEN the system SHALL produce representations for each test case.
3. WHEN testing with LLMs THEN the system SHALL compare comprehension accuracy between raw code, Holoforms, and symbolic chains.
4. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL track token usage, accuracy, and response quality.
5. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL identify optimal use cases for symbolic chain representation.

### Requirement 4: Optimization and Refinement

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to optimize symbolic chain representation based on experimental results, so that I can maximize token efficiency while maintaining semantic fidelity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing test results THEN the system SHALL identify patterns where symbolic chains excel or fail.
2. WHEN refining notation THEN the system SHALL improve symbolic vocabulary based on LLM comprehension data.
3. WHEN optimizing compression THEN the system SHALL develop techniques to achieve maximum token reduction.
4. WHEN validating improvements THEN the system SHALL demonstrate measurable gains in token efficiency or comprehension accuracy.
5. WHEN documenting optimization THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidelines for when to use symbolic chains versus other representations.
