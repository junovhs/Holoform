# Manual Testing Log - Codon Validation

**Date:** July 18, 2025  
**Phase:** Codon Refinement and Validation  
**Objective:** Systematically validate refined codon comprehension across AI models

## Testing Protocol

### Success Criteria
- **Basic tests:** Should achieve 90%+ pass rate
- **Intermediate tests:** Should achieve 80%+ pass rate  
- **Advanced tests:** Should achieve 70%+ pass rate
- **Expert tests:** Should achieve 60%+ pass rate

**If these thresholds are met, Computational DNA is VALIDATED! üß¨**

### Scoring System
- **PASS (100%):** All criteria met
- **STRONG PASS (80-99%):** 80%+ criteria met
- **WEAK PASS (60-79%):** 60-79% criteria met
- **FAIL (<60%):** <60% criteria met

## Test Results

### TEST-001: Basic Pipeline Assignment (>>=)

**Pattern:** `>>=`  
**Difficulty:** Basic  
**Category:** Flow Control  
**Date Tested:** July 18, 2025  

**Test Prompt:**
```
I'm testing a computational notation system. Please analyze this pattern:

**Pattern:** >>=

**Question:** What computational behavior does this pattern represent?

Please explain:
1. What type of operation this represents
2. The sequence of execution
3. Any conditions or requirements

Do not ask for additional context - analyze based solely on the pattern.
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Must identify this as flow control
- [ ] Must mention 'pipeline assignment'
- [ ] Must describe execution sequence
- [ ] Should not request additional context

**Expected Keywords:** pipeline, execution, sequential
