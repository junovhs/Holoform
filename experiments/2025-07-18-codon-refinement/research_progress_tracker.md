# Research Progress Tracker - Codon Refinement Phase

**Date Started:** July 18, 2025  
**Phase:** Codon Refinement and Validation  
**Status:** Phase 1 - Manual Testing Setup Complete

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created refined codon library v2.0 with enhanced precision
- [x] Built manual testing framework
- [x] Generated priority test suite (15 tests across 3 difficulty levels)
- [x] Established validation criteria and scoring system
- [x] Created ready-to-use test prompts for AI models
- [x] Set up documentation structure and logging system

### Key Deliverables
- `codon_library_v2.py` - Refined codon definitions with error handling
- `manual_testing_framework.py` - Test generation system
- `validation_criteria.md` - Objective scoring framework
- `test_001_ready_for_ai.md` through `test_003_ready_for_ai.md` - Basic tests
- `test_006_intermediate_ready_for_ai.md` - Intermediate test example
- `manual_testing_log.md` - Results tracking template

## Phase 2: Manual Validation Testing 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### Priority Codon Patterns to Test
1. **`>>=`** - Pipeline-Assignment (Flow Control)
2. **`?>=`** - Conditional-Pipeline-Assignment (Conditional Logic)
3. **`@>=`** - Scoped-Pipeline-Assignment (Context Management)
4. **`??>`** - Multi-Guard-Execution (Complex Conditions)
5. **`??=`** - Multi-Guard-Assignment (Conditional Assignment)

### Testing Matrix
| Pattern | Basic | Intermediate | Advanced | Total Tests |
|---------|-------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| >>= | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | 0/9 |
| ?>= | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | 0/9 |
| @>= | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | 0/9 |
| ??> | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | 0/9 |
| ??= | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | 0/9 |

**Total Tests to Complete:** 45 (5 patterns × 3 difficulties × 3 AI models)

### AI Models to Test
- [ ] **GPT-4o/ChatGPT** - 0/15 tests completed
- [ ] **Claude** - 0/15 tests completed  
- [ ] **Gemini** - 0/15 tests completed

### Success Criteria Tracking
- **Basic Level Target:** 90%+ pass rate → Current: 0% (0/15 tests)
- **Intermediate Level Target:** 80%+ pass rate → Current: 0% (0/15 tests)
- **Advanced Level Target:** 70%+ pass rate → Current: 0% (0/15 tests)

## Phase 3: Analysis and Refinement ⏳ PENDING

### Planned Analysis
- [ ] Cross-model comprehension comparison
- [ ] Pattern difficulty analysis
- [ ] Common failure mode identification
- [ ] Codon definition refinements based on results
- [ ] Error handling pattern validation

### Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive validation report
- Refined codon definitions (v2.1)
- Multi-model comprehension analysis
- Failure mode documentation
- Recommendations for Phase 4

## Phase 4: Scale Testing ⏳ PENDING

### Planned Scale Tests
- [ ] 500-line code body compression and comprehension
- [ ] 1000-line code body compression and comprehension
- [ ] Real-world codebase pattern extraction
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Current Immediate Actions Required

### Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **START MANUAL TESTING** - Begin with TEST-001 (>>= basic)
2. **Test with GPT-4o** - Copy prompt from `test_001_ready_for_ai.md`
3. **Record Results** - Update `manual_testing_log.md` with response
4. **Score Response** - Use validation criteria to score objectively
5. **Repeat for Claude and Gemini** - Same test, different models
6. **Move to TEST-002** - Continue systematic testing

### Files Ready for Use
- **For Testing:** `test_001_ready_for_ai.md`, `test_002_ready_for_ai.md`, `test_003_ready_for_ai.md`
- **For Scoring:** `validation_criteria.md`
- **For Recording:** `manual_testing_log.md`

## Research Quality Checkpoints

### Before Moving to Next Phase
- [ ] All basic tests completed with 90%+ pass rate
- [ ] All intermediate tests completed with 80%+ pass rate
- [ ] Cross-model consistency validated
- [ ] Failure modes documented and addressed
