## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**
To design an experiment that will correlate Holoform fidelity levels with LLM performance on downstream tasks. This will help us to establish a "loss budget" for the Holoform abstraction, which will allow us to make informed trade-offs between fidelity and compression.

## 2. Methodology

The experiment will be conducted as follows:

1.  **Generate Holoforms with varying fidelity levels.** We will create a set of Holoform generators with different levels of abstraction. For example, we could have a "high-fidelity" generator that preserves all the information in the original source code, and a "low-fidelity" generator that only preserves the most essential information.
2.  **Use the Holoforms to fine-tune an LLM.** We will use the generated Holoforms to fine-tune an LLM on a set of code understanding tasks.
3.  **Evaluate the LLM's performance.** We will evaluate the LLM's performance on a held-out set of code understanding tasks.
4.  **Correlate the LLM's performance with the Holoform fidelity level.** We will use statistical methods to correlate the LLM's performance with the Holoform fidelity level.

## 3. Expected Outcomes

The expected outcome of this experiment is a set of curves that show the trade-off between Holoform fidelity and LLM performance. These curves will allow us to make informed decisions about the level of abstraction that is appropriate for different tasks.

## 4. Simulated Results

| Fidelity Level | LLM Performance (Accuracy) |
| :--- | :--- |
| High | [Simulated] 0.95 |
| Medium | [Simulated] 0.90 |
| Low | [Simulated] 0.80 |

**Analysis:**

The simulated results show that there is a trade-off between Holoform fidelity and LLM performance. The high-fidelity Holoform results in the best LLM performance, but it also has the lowest compression ratio. The low-fidelity Holoform has the highest compression ratio, but it also results in the worst LLM performance.

**Conclusion:**

The "loss budget" for the Holoform abstraction will depend on the specific task. For tasks that require high accuracy, a high-fidelity Holoform is appropriate. For tasks where a lower accuracy is acceptable, a lower-fidelity Holoform can be used to achieve a higher compression ratio.
