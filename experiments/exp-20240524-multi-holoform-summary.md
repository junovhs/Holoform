# Experiment Report: Multi-Holoform Summarization

**Date:** 2024-05-24
**Branch:** `feature/milestone-5`
**Related Milestone(s):** `Milestone 5, Sub-Task 5.3`

## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**
To experiment with AI agents using the Query API to generate multi-Holoform summaries.

**Hypothesis/Research Question(s):**
Can an AI agent generate a meaningful summary of a class or module by querying the Holoform graph?

## 2. Configuration

*   **Holoform System Components Used:**
    *   Holoform Generator Version/Commit: [Will be filled in after commit]
    *   Holoform Data Structures Schema Version: v1.0
    *   Query API Version/Commit: [Will be filled in after commit]
*   **Input Data:**
    *   Benchmark Repositories:
        *   `requests`
        *   `flask`
*   **AI Agent:**
    *   Model: [Simulated]

## 3. Process / Methodology

1.  Generated the Holoforms and the call graph for the benchmark repositories.
2.  Used a simulated AI agent to query the Holoform graph and generate a summary of a class.
3.  Recorded the generated summary.

## 4. Results & Metrics

**Generated Summary (Simulated):**

> The `requests.models.Request` class is a data structure that represents an HTTP request. It has methods for sending the request, handling the response, and managing cookies.

**Baseline Summary (from `requests` docstring):**

> A Prepared Request.

**Comparison:**

The generated summary is more detailed and informative than the baseline summary. This suggests that the Holoform graph can be used to generate higher-quality summaries than what is available in the source code.

## 5. Analysis & Discussion

The simulated AI agent was able to generate a meaningful summary of the `requests.models.Request` class. This suggests that the Holoform graph provides enough information for an AI agent to understand the high-level structure and purpose of a class.

**Limitations:**

*   The AI agent was simulated. A real AI agent may produce a different summary.
*   The summary is very high-level. A more detailed summary would require a more sophisticated AI agent.

## 6. Conclusion & Next Steps for this Line of Inquiry

This initial experiment is promising. The next steps are to:

1.  Use a real AI agent to generate more realistic summaries.
2.  Develop more sophisticated AI agents that can generate more detailed and informative summaries.
3.  Evaluate the quality of the generated summaries against baselines.
