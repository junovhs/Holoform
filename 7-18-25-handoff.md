Standards Established: Comprehensive documentation requirements for all future experiments
Phase 2: Standard Holoform Failure Analysis
Critical Discovery: JSON-based structured Holoform representations increased token usage by 400-500%
Root Cause: Verbose metadata, redundant nesting, token-heavy format optimized for machines, not tokenizers
Strategic Pivot: Validated that symbolic notation, not structured data, is the correct path forward

Strategic Insights & Principles Established
What We Will NOT Build (Traps Avoided)
Universal Assembly Language Fallacy - No low-level operational details (UNCOL/Rhizome trap)
Theoretical Purity Trap - No lambda calculus minimalism that obscures meaning
Verbose AST Trap - No 1:1 syntactic representation (original Holoform failure)
One-Size-Fits-All IR - Purpose-built for AI comprehension, not general compilation
What We WILL Build (Core Principles)
Semantic Intent Focus - Capture why, not how; meaning over mechanics
Pattern-Oriented Design - Empirical observation of real-world code patterns
AI-First Architecture - Every decision optimized for LLM understanding and token efficiency
Hub-and-Spoke Vision - Universal semantic IR with language-specific adapters
Intelligent Lossiness - Deliberate about what to preserve vs. discard
